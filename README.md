##### What is a Middleware in a web application?
It is a layer that sits between 2 parts of your system
In Backend: Between the **request** & the **response**
In Frontend: Between the **dispatched actions** and the **store** in Redux

Why do we need it?
Backend: To process things before hitting the final endpoint
Frontend: To handle async operations/API calls, to dispatch other actions based on the side effects

Middleware is used mainly to handle the side effects

Common Redux middlewares are:
- redux-thunk (simple async logic with functions)
- redux-saga (complex async flows using generators)
- redux-logger (logs every action & state change)

###### What is createSagaMiddleware()?
It's a function from the redux-saga library
It creates a middleware that sits between redux **actions** & the **reducer** and runs your generator functions (**sagas**) when specific actions are dispatched.

###### Note: Redux reducers must be pure - they can't do things like API calls, waits, background retries or debounced updates, etc

Thus, we use **redux-saga** to handle all this logic **outside the reducer**, while still keeping things **tied to Redux**

createSagaMiddleware() is needed so that Redux knows **how to use sagas**.

1) Create the saga middleware:
const sagaMiddleware = createSagaMiddleware();

2) Add it to Redux
const store = createStore(
  rootReducer,
  applyMiddleware(sagaMiddleware)
);

3) Start the sagas
sagaMiddleware.run(rootSaga);

The above code will watch for specific redux actions and when they occur, it triggers the respective generator function that you define to handle them (e.g., making API calls)
